# SchriftSkala

This is a simple utility to calculate the font sizes for a typographic scale. It is based on
the [modular scale](http://www.modularscale.com/) principles.

I have created this tool because I was tired of calculating the font sizes for a typographic scale by hand. I have used
the [modular scale](http://www.modularscale.com/) principles for a quite a while and I wanted to have a tool that would
calculate the font sizes for me. There are many similar tools outside, but simply I wanted to have one that I can use the
way I want.

It is still **WiP**, and I am planning to add some more features to it.
